For this project, I will synthesise the data contained in the above dataset. 

It consists of monthly rainfall records for a Met Ã‰ireann station at Bonham St. in Co. Dublin.

The data contains 170 rows. (The first 13 being descriptors of the data)

There are 7 columns of data included in the data set:

* year - Year
* month - Month
* rain - Precipitation Amount (mm)
* gdf - Greatest daily fall (mm)
* rd - Number of rain days (0.2mm or more)
* wd - Number of wet days (1.0 mm or more)	
* ind - Indicator

I decided to chnage my dataset to this rainfall dataset at hte last minute and so did not have enough time to complete this projectt as well as I could have.

I also made the mistake of spending too much time trying to figure out converting the year/month columns into time series and also too much time not realizing that most of my integer/float columns were being read in as strings adn that is why some of my plots has not been appearing correctly.
